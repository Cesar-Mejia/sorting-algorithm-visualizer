# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This project contains implementations of several popular sorting algorithms using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The project can be viewed at https://cesar-mejia.github.io/sorting-algorithm-visualizer/

## Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this visualizer:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort 

## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the array is repeated until the array is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the array as the sort progresses.

## Selection sort
Selection sort divides the input array into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire array. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It compares the current item to the items already sorted, and places it in the correct position. It repeats this process for each item in the array.

## Merge sort
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array in half, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. This results in a fully sorted array. The merge step is performed using a merge function that compares the first element of each half and takes the smaller one, repeating this process until one half is exhausted, at which point the remaining elements of the other half are appended to the output array.

## Quick sort
Quick sort is an algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.
